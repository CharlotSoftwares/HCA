# HCA - Highly Compressed Archive Utility    
  
Not exact, change PATH and other stuff.  
  
Version: 1.7.0 BETA  
  
---  
  
## Overview  
  
HCA is a command-line utility to compress and extract folders/files into a highly compressed archive format (`.hca`).    
It supports multi-threaded compression, AES-256 encryption with password, split archives, deletion of original files after compression (with confirmations), and detailed metadata.  
  
---  
  
## Features  
  
- Compress entire folders with multi-threading for speed.  
- Extract archives with integrity checks.  
- List contents and metadata of archives.  
- AES-256 password encryption/decryption.  
- Split archives into 50MB parts for easier handling.  
- Confirmed deletion of original files after successful compression.  
- Safe filename enforcement.  
- Detailed progress and messages.  
- Manual (`--man`), help (`--help`), and summary (`--tldr`) commands.  
- Version information display.  
- Error codes for scripting.

## Requirements  
  
- Python 3.7+  
- `pycryptodome` library (`pip install pycryptodome`)

```bash                          
python hca.py --compress myfolder --output backup.hca --password --split --delete                           
```

```bash                
python hca.py --extract backup.hca --output extracted_folder --password    
```    
    
List archive contents:  
                                     
```bash                 
python hca.py --list backup.hca                    
```

```bash               
python hca.py --version            
```

## Notes             
                                 
* Only filenames with letters, digits, dash, underscore, dot, and spaces are supported for safety.                            
* Password encryption uses AES-256-CBC.                   
* Splitting creates multiple files named like `backup.hca.part1`, `backup.hca.part2`, etc.                 
* During deletion, the tool asks twice before removing each file.                  
* Metadata includes creator user, creation timestamp, file count, and archive version.                    
* Multi-threading uses up to 4 threads for compression workers.

## Building Windows Executable (.exe)                                               
              
To build a standalone Windows executable using PyInstaller:             
                 
1. Install PyInstaller:               
                
```bash                                           
pip install pyinstaller                   
```                  
               
2. Run:           
               
```bash                                    
pyinstaller --onefile hca.py            
```                     
               
3. The executable will be in the `dist` folder as `hca.exe`.              
    
* Consider adding the file to PATH.
